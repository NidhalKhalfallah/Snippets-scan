#This function takes in the ID of the VIP merchandise to buy as a URL parameter. It also assumes that there are two helper functions is_authorized and make_purchase. is_authorized is used to validate that the user is authorized to make the purchase, and make_purchase is used to actually process the purchase.

#You can replace the implementation of these helper functions to match your use case.
